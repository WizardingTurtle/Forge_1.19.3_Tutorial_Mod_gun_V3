# Forge_1.19.3_Tutorial_Mod_gun_V3
A practice project where I learnt the basics of adding iitems, networking to apply player capabilities, brian pain, advanced items (e.g. a gun), learnt how to google the right questions to solve my problems, realised i love the pain.
p.s. if you are looking to learn how to simulate a gun from my mod, the files you're looking should have a gun related title, have fun digging the gold out of this pile of code dump
